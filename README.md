# Least-Mean-Square-LMS-Algorithm-Adaptive-Signal-Processing

1. The input output relation for an unknown system is given in the attached file. 
    a. Considering the system to be a linear transversal filter, apply LMS algorithm to obtain the system parameters (filter coefficients) of the unknown system. [Use MATLAB or similar platform]
        i. For output without noise
        ii. For noisy output
    b. Plot magnitude of error as a function of iteration count for three different values of step size parameter.
    c. Study the effect of different type of noise. 
        i. Uniformly distributed noise 
        ii. Additive White Gaussian Noise

Add noise in the output signal such that the SNR is 10dB. Observe the plot of magnitude of error as a function of iteration count. Also, comment on the effect of noise distribution on the 
error. (Use same step size parameter value for both type of noise to compare the results.)

2. Repeat the exercise (a.) and (b.) with NLMS algorithm.
